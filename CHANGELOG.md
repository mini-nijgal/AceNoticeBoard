## Origin

I completed the fullstackopen course to learn React, and I need a project to work on. I saw this idea on c2 wiki of this person that writes his dissociated thoughts on a post it note, sticking it up on a wall and forming a collection of serendipitous inspiration. ![c2 wiki image](c2.jpg)

I also stumbled upon [kormyen's memex](https://kormyen.github.io/memex/), which was a nice implementation of this idea.

I decided to build a tool for myself, because why not?

I struggled with the name for the longest time. I liked the meaning of the word and using an uncommon Chinese word is cool to me (compared to fancy Japanese words wow). But to spell out a word that gets the idea across is quite challenging. I think 'tyea' fits the best but it perhaps still isn't as good as 'tiÄ“' either. Other ideas I had:

- Tyeah
- Theah
- Thyea
- Tiye
- Teaea (like 'queue')
- Tieh

## Some potential todo/improvements

- Able to add comments after the notes are made -> should this be the formation of a brand new note that hyperlinks to the original? Or should I just tack on comments/further understanding at the bottom?
- Pagination? Or infinite scroll? So far performance was ok for up to 300+ posts. Time shall tell whether I have to implement this feature... 
- Able to return a random todo resource
- Connect my API to a Telegram bot so I can go back to messaging stuff to myself :") ...
