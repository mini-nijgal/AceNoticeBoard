As someone who is a scientist who studies crows, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls jackdaws crows. If you want to be \"specific\" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing. If you're saying \"crow family\" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Corvidae, which includes things from nutcrackers to blue jays to ravens. So your reasoning for calling a jackdaw a crow is because random people \"call the black ones crows?\" Let's get grackles and blackbirds in there, then, too."],
